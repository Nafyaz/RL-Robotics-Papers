My perfectly imperfect note-taking system for ML papers: https://mindfulmodeler.substack.com/p/my-perfectly-imperfect-note-taking

: How do I know what to highlight / focus / give importance?
: Welp, at first you write / highlight what you think is important. After doing this for many papers, you will start to understand what's important and what's not. After about a month return back to old read papers and see how differently you would highlight / take notes.
