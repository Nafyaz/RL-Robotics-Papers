1. Foundation Models and Large-Scale Learning:

    A major thrust in recent research involves integrating foundation models (FMs), including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), into robotic systems [1] [2]. These models provide powerful capabilities for understanding natural language instructions, reasoning about tasks, and enabling zero-shot or few-shot generalization [3] [4].
    Papers like GR00T N1 introduce open foundation models specifically for humanoid robots, using a dual-system architecture (vision-language + diffusion transformer) trained on diverse data including real robot trajectories, human videos, and synthetic datasets [5].
    Frameworks like COME-robot utilize GPT-4V for closed-loop reasoning and adaptive planning in real-world mobile manipulation tasks [6]. STEER focuses on training language-grounded policies with dense annotation to bridge high-level reasoning and low-level control [7].
    The development of large-scale datasets and benchmarks is crucial. AgiBot World introduces a platform with over 1 million trajectories across numerous tasks and proposes a generalist policy (GO-1) showing scalable performance [8]. The Open X-Embodiment dataset and RT-X models also represent efforts in this direction [9].
    UniAct proposes a framework using a tokenized "Universal Action Space" to handle heterogeneity in action spaces across different robots, enhancing cross-domain data utilization and generalization [10].
    Heterogeneous Pre-trained Transformers (HPT) investigate pre-training large policy networks on data from diverse embodiments and tasks to create general, shareable representations [11].

2. Advanced Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning:

    Imitation Learning (IL): IL, especially from human demonstrations, remains a core technique. Recent work focuses on scaling IL with large datasets [12], improving generalization [13], and making it more data-efficient [14].
        Regularized Optimal Transport (ROT) combines trajectory-matching rewards with behavior cloning for faster imitation [15].
        Reasoning through Action-free Data (RAD) leverages language-based reasoning from action-free human videos to train generalizable policies [13].
        NIL proposes learning motor skills from 2D videos generated by diffusion models, bypassing the need for expert 3D demonstrations [16].
    Reinforcement Learning (RL): Deep RL (DRL) continues to be applied for complex control tasks, including locomotion and manipulation [17] [18].
        Challenges in real-world RL, such as sample efficiency and reward design, are actively being addressed [19] [20].
        FLaRe proposes a large-scale RL fine-tuning framework for pre-trained policies, achieving SOTA performance on mobile manipulation tasks [21].
        Self-Improving Robots: MEDAL++ aims for robots that learn autonomously by learning to both do and undo tasks, inferring rewards from initial demonstrations [22]. SOAR uses foundation models for autonomous data collection and self-supervised improvement [23].
        Offline RL and data-driven methods are gaining traction, using pre-collected datasets [20].
        Diffusion models are being integrated into policies, such as Diffusion Policy [24] and DiT-Block Policy [25].
    Combining IL and RL: Many approaches combine IL for pre-training or bootstrapping with RL for fine-tuning or improving robustness [21].

3. Generalization, Transferability, and Data Augmentation:

    A key goal is developing policies that generalize to new tasks, objects, and environments [26] [27].
    Techniques include multi-task learning [26], learning from diverse data [11], and using robust representations [10].
    Data augmentation is critical. Generative Augmentation uses semantic scene augmentations to expand small real-world datasets [28]. EAGLE proposes control-aware augmentation to avoid disrupting task-relevant information [29]. HybridGen uses VLMs and hybrid planning to generate diverse demonstration data [30].

4. Specific Applications and Benchmarks:

    Manipulation: Dexterous manipulation [26], vision-based manipulation [31] [32], bimanual manipulation [33], and long-horizon tasks [34] are common focuses. Benchmarks like HumanoidBench [35], ARNOLD [36], and Mimicking-Bench [37] are being developed.
    Locomotion & Navigation: Learning locomotion for humanoids [35], mobile robot navigation [38], and vision-and-language navigation [39] are explored.
    Human-Robot Interaction: RL is used in social robotics [40] [40] and for learning from human preferences or feedback [41] [42].

5. Surveys and Frameworks:

    Several recent surveys provide overviews of RL in robotics [17] [18] [43], deep RL for manipulation [43], and the integration of foundation models [1] [2].
    Frameworks like PIC4rl-gym [38] and Robel [19] provide tools for research.

In summary, the state-of-the-art involves scaling learning using large, diverse datasets and powerful foundation models, combined with sophisticated RL and IL algorithms, aiming for generalist robots capable of complex tasks in real-world environments. The focus is shifting from task-specific specialists to adaptable, general-purpose agents.
