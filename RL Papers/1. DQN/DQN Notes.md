### Abstract

- Previously RL was limited to domains where features can be handcrafted, or in domains with fully observed low dimensional state spaces.
- Introduces deep neural netwroek (Deep Q Network) that learns policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs.
- Tested in 49 Atari 2600 games using same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters.
